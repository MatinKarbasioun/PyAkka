# PyAkka

**PyAkka** is a Python library that brings the power and flexibility of Akka.NET and Akka to the Python ecosystem. With PyAkka, you can build highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications using an actor-based model. PyAkka provides asynchronous messaging, supervision, clustering, and sharding capabilities, making it a versatile tool for modern Python developers.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Leverage Python's `asyncio` to support non-blocking, asynchronous communication between actors.
- **Supervision**: Implement fault tolerance by defining supervisors that can restart or stop actors in case of failure.
- **Clustering**: Build scalable and distributed systems with PyAkka's clustering capabilities.
- **Sharding**: Efficiently distribute actors across the cluster to balance the load and enhance performance. (under development)

## Installation

To install PyAkka, use pip:

```bash
pip install pyAkka
```
